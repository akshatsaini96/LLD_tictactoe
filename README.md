# ðŸŽ® Tic Tac Toe - Low Level Design (LLD)

This is a simple object-oriented design of the **Tic Tac Toe** game using Java. It's built using clean code and good design practices. The goal is to understand how to design a game like this in a structured way.

## ðŸ’¡ What This Project Does

- Lets 2 or more players play Tic Tac Toe
- Works with any board size (like 3x3, 4x4, etc.)
- Tracks if someone wins, draws, or if the game is still going
- Code is written in a way thatâ€™s easy to extend (like adding a bot in future)
